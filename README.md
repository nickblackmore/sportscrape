# sportscrape
Scrapes sports statistics from Sports Reference and stores them in local SQLite databases or
Pandas DataFrames. Gives the user control over the structure of the databases py passing
the local path to the database and table name. 

Current functionality allows for player data to be scraped from Baseball-Reference and 
Football-Reference.

This is a work in progress and will probably never be 'finished'. The inspiration for this project
was, being a bit of a sports statistics junky, that I wanted  more control over pulling data
off of sports-reference. Originally, I just wanted to a way to quickly compare the career
statistics of two players, but as I thought of new ways to look at the data, I wanted a
way to gather as much data as I could, then analyze it in python later. Additionally, it became fun 
for me to figure out new ways to scrape, organize, and store the data. Nowadays, I normally try to add
new features or functionality whenever my schedule allows, normally over the holidays. 

This project is also not meant to be a production-ready library nor is it meant to be the most
efficient way do this.
